This README describes the simplest way to start a webpack build of React+Redux+ReactRouter.

It's an updated version of <a href="https://github.com/nzhong/react-redux-webpack-minimal">this repo</a>, with the following addition:

- added React-Router
- webpack 1 turned into webpack 2 (actually 3)
- split vendor.js and app.js

Steps to install & run:

- git clone https://github.com/nzhong/react-redux-router-webpack2-minimal
- cd react-redux-router-webpack2-minimal
- npm install
- npm start


Later on, one can

- ./node_modules/.bin/webpack -p
